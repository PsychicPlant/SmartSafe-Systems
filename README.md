# SmartSafe Systems

Welcome to my 2023 graduation project!
This project was done in next to 5 months while I was still taking other classes, so it is not a polished product.

However, in its current form, the project is a big milestone for me and its a great showcase of my skillset and potential when it comes to Hardware and Software engineering.

# Description

SmartSafe Systems is a **safekeeping & surveilance** product.
It consists of hardware and software elements that **read, validade and register** two factors of a person's security metrics: their fingerprints and a 6 digit combination of their choosing.
It also contains built-in surveilance and modular violation settings.

The device has a User Interface, as well as a Management Interface, and a terminal application.
The UI exists in the physical layer using an LCD screen.
The MI exists as a locally hosted website.
The terminal application is run on the central computing device.

# Details

The system will consist of:

• A **magnetic solenoid** that is activated by a mechanism controlled via a
  microcontroller, in this case the ATMEGA8515;
  
• A user input system which is comprised of a **twelve(12) digit keypad**, which is
  also controlled by the ATMEGA8515, and a **capacitive touch fingerprint
  scanner**, controlled by an Arduino Nano;
  
• A validation system, being also the administrator interface, comprised of a **Linux
  desktop application & locally hosted Webserver**;
  
• A **16x2 character LCD Screen**, again controlled by the AVR microchip;

• A **5MP 1080p OV5647 Raspberry Pi Camera Module**;

• A **Raspberry Pi 4b**;

• An **Arduino Nano 33 IoT**;

• An **ATMEGA8215** programmable microcontroller.
